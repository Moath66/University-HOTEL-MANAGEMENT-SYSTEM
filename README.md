# University Hotel Management System

## About
The **University Hotel Management System** is a simulation project built using **C++** that models the operations of a hotel management system. This system is designed to automate and manage essential hotel functions such as room bookings, customer check-ins/outs, and customer information management. The project focuses on using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles to structure the system efficiently.

## Features
- **Room Reservation**: Users can add, update, and delete room bookings based on room availability.
- **Customer Information Management**: The system allows easy storage and retrieval of customer details, including name, contact information, and booking history.
- **Check-In/Check-Out Process**: Manages the process of customer check-ins and check-outs, updating room statuses and availability.
- **Room Availability Tracking**: Tracks room availability in real-time to prevent overbookings and manage room occupancy efficiently.
- **Text-Based User Interface**: A simple text-based interface that allows users to interact with the system to manage bookings and customers.
- **Room Status Management**: Each room’s status is managed (available, booked, occupied), making it easy to track the hotel’s operational status.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language for implementing all system functionalities and business logic.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Used to model hotel entities (rooms, customers, bookings) and their interactions.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Utilized for managing data structures like vectors, lists, and maps to store room and customer information efficiently.

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW, or Clang) installed on your machine.
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or Sublime Text).
